            Mithila is known as the birthplace of <strong>Mata Sita</strong> and{" "}

            depicted through the world-famous{" "}
            <strong>Mithila paintings</strong>, narrating stories from the epic
            Ramayana.

            The production of Makhana begins with the harvesting of seeds from
            ponds — a remarkable process done entirely by hand. Without even
            looking, harvesters sense the seeds beneath the water using only
            their palms and fingers.

            This herculean task involves almost the entire village. For one
            special day, everyone comes together — harvesting, sharing meals,
            enjoying each other’s company, and celebrating the joy of Makhana
            harvesting.
